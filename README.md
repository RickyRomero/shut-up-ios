## Shut Up

[Shut Up][homepage] is an open source project for blocking comment sections in all mainstream web browsers.

This is the version of Shut Up for Safari on iOS and iPadOS. **For all intents and purposes it should be considered deprecated**, because I built it when I was a Git/Swift newbie and was still learning how things worked. It's long overdue for a clean rewrite.

A [WebExtension version of Shut Up][shut-up-webextension] is available which supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. A brand-new, less embarrassing version for Safari on [macOS][shut-up-native] is also available.

This app leverages [shutup.css][shutup-css] by [Steven Frank][site-steven] and contributors, which is used with permission.
